PokéApp Walkthrough:

    Starting the App: When the user opens the app, they are greeted with the title "PokéApp" prominently displayed at the top.

    Entering a Pokémon's Name: Below the title, there's an input box prompting the user to "Enter Pokémon name". The user can type the name of any Pokémon they're curious about.

    Fetching the Data: After typing in a Pokémon's name, the user can press the "Get Pokémon" button located just below the input box.

    Displaying the Pokémon Data:

        If the user entered a valid Pokémon name and there's no issue with the data retrieval, the app will display:
            An image of the Pokémon.
            The Pokémon's name.
            The Pokémon's height.
            The Pokémon's weight.
            The type or types of the Pokémon (e.g., water, fire, grass, etc.).

        If there's an error (like if the Pokémon name doesn't exist or there's an issue with the network connection), the app will display an error message like "Failed to fetch Pokémon data".

    Continued Interaction: The user can choose to enter another Pokémon's name and press the "Get Pokémon" button again to fetch new data. The displayed information will update accordingly.
